      <p>
        Are you interested in learning more about Formula 1? 
        Have you heard people talk about Formula 1 or F1, and think what is that? 
        Sector One is here to provide a rundown on all the basics of Formula 1. 
      </p>
      <p>
        WHAT IS FORMULA ONE? <br> Formula 1, or F1 for short, is the highest international racing class for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars. 
        Formula 1 is known for its unparalleled speed and technology. 
        Formula 1 races on international circuits worldwide throughout the year, making it a global spectacle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        BATTLE OF CHAMPIONSHIPS <br> 
        F1 consists of 10 teams, each with 2 drivers, competing for two championships. 
        Teams compete to build the fastest, most technologically advanced cars to win the Constructors’ Championship. 
        Drivers battle on the track to win the most points for the World Drivers’ Championship.
        In the 2023 season, Max Verstappen was crowned World Champion, and his team, Red Bull, was crowned the winner of the Constructors Championship.

      <h3>Race Week</h3>
      <p>
        FRIDAY - PRACTICE <br>
        A traditional race weekend has three free practice sessions. FP1 and FP2 are on friday.
        Each free practice is an hour-long practice where teams can run laps and collect data for the upcoming race. <br>
        SATURDAY - QUALIFYING <br>
        Saturday starts with FP3, where teams have one last practice session to complete their data for the weekend and finalize their strategy for qualifying.  
        Qualifying is an hour-long session split into three sessions (Q1, Q2, Q3). 
        During each session, drivers compete to put in the fastest lap time. The faster the lap, the higher you will start for the race. 
        The bottom five slowest drivers of Q1 and Q2 are knocked out from moving on to the next session. In Q3, the top 10 drivers battle for first position, 
        or called pole position. Each driver's placement at the end of qualifying decides his starting position for the race. <br>
        SUNDAY - RACE DAY <br>
        IT’S RACE DAY! The race is approximately two hours long. All drivers must complete a formation lap before the race starts and take at least one pit-stop before the race ends. <br>
        POINTS <br>
        Points are awarded to drivers based on their positions at the end of the race. <br>
        DURING THE RACE - the top ten drivers at the end of the race are awarded points 
        (1-25 2-18 3-15 4-12 5-10 6-8 7-6 8-4 9-2 10-1.)
        The driver that sets the fastest lap in the race gets one extra point. 
        The top three drivers participate in a podium ceremony and are awarded 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place trophies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        SPRINT WEEKEND <br>
        Sprint races were introduced in 2021, to create more action in the Formula One season. A sprint race is a shortened version of a normal race. <br>
        HOW DO SPRINT WEEKENDS WORK? <br>
        On Friday, the only practice session is held before the usual qualifying setup, which sets the order for the race on Sunday. 
        On Saturday, a sprint shootout is held, which is like qualifying for the sprint race, and decides the order of the sprint race which is held later that day. 
        The sprint is set up like a normal race but with a number of laps equivalent to 100km, which is a lot shorter than a usual race. Sunday is the full race as usual. <br>
        SPRINT POINTS - the top eight drivers at the end of the sprint are awarded points 
        (1-8 2-7 3-6 4-5 5-4 6-3 7-2 8-1)

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        For each of the wireframes, header and footer, I accidentally switched up the order for the page "Drivers and Teams". It is supposed to be "Teams and Drivers".
        I will make sure it is the right way when I create the pages.
