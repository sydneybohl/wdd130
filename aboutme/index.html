    <h2>Sydney Bohl</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm excited to be in this class with you all.</p>
    <p>My name is Sydney Bohl. I'm from Wisconsin, USA. I just graduated high school a few years ago. I love to read, listen to music, binge watch my favorite TV shows, be creative, and play video games when I have free-time. 
        Regarding school, I love math, computers, and problem solving. I love learning and always want to learn something new. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints all my life. I didn't know how I wanted to further my education and found about BYU-Pathways through the church. 
        It has been a major blessing in my life. Through BYU-I, I hope to obtain a software development degree. I love that through this class I can learn more about HTML and CSS. My first introduction to coding in middle school was basic HTML and CSS. I enjoyed it a lot and can't wait to learn more.</p>
